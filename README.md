## <a name="app"></a>About The App
* Collecting user's input and generating a Magic 8 Ball reponse:
To collect the user's input, a submit form was created to take in the user's question.
# <img src="https://github.com/Grxcelynx/magic8ball/blob/main/ReadMeImages/html.png">
By gathering all the elements from the HTML by their ID, a class was made to set the varibles and sources for the Magic 8 Ball images. Setting the src path to the folder which contained all the Magic 8 Ball images to be iterated through.

Then creating helper functions and test cases for the form to ensure:

* A timer for the images to create the same effect of the orginal Magic 8 Ball
